FINANCIAL API TESTING INSTRUCTIONS
==================================

1. Start the API server:
   python financial_ai_server.py

2. The server should run on http://localhost:8000

3. Manual testing files created:
   - sample_bank_statement.csv (for /upload/statements)

4. Test endpoints using curl or Postman:

   Health Check:
   GET http://localhost:8000/health

   Upload Bank Statement:
   POST http://localhost:8000/upload/statements
   (Upload sample_bank_statement.csv as 'files')

   Tax Analysis:
   POST http://localhost:8000/analyze/tax
   Form data: annual_income=1200000, current_investments={"80C": 50000}

   Chat Query:
   POST http://localhost:8000/chat/query
   JSON: {"question": "How much tax can I save with ELSS investment?"}

5. Run this test suite:
   python test_financial_api.py

Expected Results:
- Health check should return status 200
- Statement upload should categorize transactions correctly
- Tax analysis should calculate both regimes
